        <div id="Textbox">Welcome to Dean's Shell from H*** Program manager. Please follow all instructions to get set up.
            <ol>
                <li>If you haven't gotten a Shelly Program before, Please go to file explorer, click on this PC, click on Local Disk (C:), and then make a new folder there titled EXCACLY "ShellyPrograms". Whenever you get programs from me don't change any names and put them into that folder and no others for them to function properly.</li>
                <li>Click on a program you would like to download. It may bring you to a page that says this program is infected with a virus. Sometimes google drive will think that certain lines of code in these projects indicate a virus. They are completely harmless. The most they do is shut down your computer.</li>
                <li>After you have downloaded the folder, you should see the zip file of the program you downloaded in your downloads folder. Go to that and right click the folder. When it brings up the options hit extract all.</li>
                <li>When it tells you to go to a file location hit browse. You need to then navigate in that window to This PC, Local Disk (C:), then your ShellyPrograms folder, and then once you are inside the ShellyPrograms folder (not inside another program's folder) hit select folder in the bottom left.</li>
                <li>Now if you go into ShellyPrograms you should see the new and working program for you to begin using!</li>
            </ol>
            Make sure If you are using the old A90 Program you only use A90.exe and A90F.exe as the files you launch. The content data is not hidden like it is in the other files.
            <h3>DISCLAIMER: Bitcoin Miner, Parrot Program, Noot Noot Program, and A90 Program have no way to turn off once activated!</h3>
            <p>These Programs will eventually shut down your computer or force you to.</p>

        <p>Descriptions:
            <ul>
                <li>Bitcoin Miner: a funny program that basically makes your computer unusable with lag machines and amazing sound effects</li>
                <li>Rooms Service: a program that brings the monsters from the rooms subfloor of Doors Roblox to your desktop. For A60 and A120, if your mouse touches them, you fail. For A60 you need to move your mouse to the bottom of your screen and for A120 you need to alternate it between the top and bottom. Lastly, for A90, you need to stop moving your mouse and dont type on your keyboadr when it shows up or you'll fail. Faliure will either do nothing or shut down your computer based on what you put in.</li>
                <li>Parrot Program: a ticking time bomb that will show you an ascii.live parrot about every 30 seconds. The rate of parrots spawning will start to increase until it shuts down your computer.</li>
                <li>NootNoot Program: a ticking time bomb that will do a variety of things such as show you unclosable pictures of noot noot, play a video of noot noot, or (courtesy of NootCons) change all your desktop icons to noot noot. Then he will shut down your computer.</li>
                <li>A90 Program: This is an older version of Rooms service that just has A90. I recommed using that until I update this program but if you only want the A90 Monster, this will do that. When you load in you will notice there is a bunch of files. When I made my older scripts I wasn't as good at organizing. For everything to work please click only on A90.exe and A90F.exe. In A90.exe, if you fail, it does nothing but in A90F.exe, it shuts down your computer if you fail.</li>
            </ul>
